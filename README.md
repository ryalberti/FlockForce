Our goal is to create a two-dimensional visualization of signals mimicking a saturation map using a set of software defined radios. By using a set of three or more SDRs, we are able to triangulate the relative position and estimated transmission power of such signals. These SDRs can be attached to any variety of controlled device such as aircrafts, drones, or submarines.
