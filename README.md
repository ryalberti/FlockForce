Stevens Institute of Technology 2023-2024 Senior Design project 

Our goal is to create a two-dimensional visualization of signals mimicking a saturation map using a set of software defined radios. By using a set of three or more SDRs, we are able to triangulate the relative position and estimated transmission power of such signals. These SDRs can be attached to any variety of controlled device such as aircrafts, drones, or submarines. 

Associated hardware:
 * 4x NI USRP-2901
 * 4x VERT2450
 * 4x VERT900
 * 4x VERT400
note: will require external power for our purposes 

For installation:
1. Install LabVIEW Communications System Design Software
2. Install NI-USRP
